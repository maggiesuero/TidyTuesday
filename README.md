# TidyTuesday
Tidy Tuesday weekly social data projects in R
The original project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, as a way to understand how to summarize and tidy data to make meaningful data visualizations using R packages.
Every week, they provide a new dataset for learning and practice purposes. 
In this repo, there are my examples for Tidy Tuesday.
